## How to Customize the Template 🛠️

### 1. Editing Content

- To edit content, open the corresponding \*.html files in an editor like VSCode or Notepad++.
- Search for the content you want to change and edit it to your preference.
- Save the file and reopen the HTML file in the browser to see your changes.

### 2. Modifying Styles

- The main style is located in **css/main.css** and can be edited if you're familiar with CSS.
- Premium versions include SCSS source files that generate all template styles. You can use these to make changes and regenerate the CSS.

### 3. Updating Images

- Change images within the **images/** folder.
- Ensure the new image files have the same names as the original ones.
- If renaming image files, update the corresponding references in the HTML files.

## How to Use the Template 🚀

1. Upload the template contents to your webserver.
2. Ensure that **index.html** is in the main (root) folder of your webserver.
3. Avoid renaming template folders or files unless you know how to update references in HTML files.
4. For web hosting, consider [TemplateFlip hosting](https://templateflip.com/go/hosting) for easy FTP file uploads.

🎉 **Fun Fact**: Most of this was coded on an iPad because my laptop was damaged while creating this! 🙌
